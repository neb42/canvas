# Navigating the UI

## Terminal

When running `yarn start` the terminal will open. 

![Terminal](/ui-studio/terminal/terminal.png)

The terminal will show output in three sections. 

#### Component builder

![Terminal: component builder](/ui-studio/terminal/component-builder.png)

When making changes to any [React components](/components/react) or in `package.json` 
the component builder will compile and install these changes to the client.
The top-right box in the terminal will show the output of the compilation and installation.

#### API runner

![Terminal: API runner](/ui-studio/terminal/api-runner.png)

The output of the [API](/api/introduction) is shown in the bottom left.

#### Client runner

![Terminal: Client runner](/ui-studio/terminal/client-runner.png)

The output of the clien is shown in the bottom right.
This includes the package installation output and the output of the webpack dev server.

## Page editor

![Editor](/ui-studio/editor/editor.png)

Once the initial build has finished the editor will be opened in the browser.
The initial tree will be empty, but the above image has been populated with some widgets as an example.

### Page selection

![Editor: page selection](/ui-studio/editor/page-selection.png)

On the far left is the page navigation. 
The first item opens the page editor, the second opens the variable editor, and the third the CSS editor.

### Widget tree

![Editor: widget tree](/ui-studio/editor/tree.png)

The widget tree is where you can add pages/components (a root), 
change the current root, and add/edit/remove widgets from the current root.
This dropdown at the top will change the current root and the buttons to the side will add/remove it.

Each node on the tree has one or two buttons. All nodes have a button to remove it, and it's children, from the tree.
Once removed a node is not deleted, but can be added in again.
If a node supports children it will have an add button.
This will open a menu with components that are organised into categories.
Clicking a component will add an instance of it (a widget) to the tree as a child of the current node.

### Client preview 

![Editor: client preview](/ui-studio/editor/client.png)

In the middle of the page is a preview of the client being built.
This will update in real time as changes are made.
The size of the preview can be changed with the controls above.

### Widget configuration

![Editor: widget configuration](/ui-studio/editor/config.png)

The right hand panel contains the configuration for the currently selected widget in the tree.
The contents will change depending on the widget's component, but will be a selection of
[Config (Widget)](/widgets/config), [Events](/widgets/events), [Layout](/widgets/layout), [Styles](/widgets/styles), [Properties and Config (Component)](/components/widgets).

## Variable editor

![Editor: variables](/ui-studio/editor/variables.png)

On the variable editor page you can add/remove variables in the side bar, and edit in the centre.
