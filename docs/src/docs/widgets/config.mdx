# Widget config

A widget's config defines how it is rendered to the screen.
If you are familiar with React the config can be thought of as a component's props.

For example, the built in `Text` widget has a config item called `text`. This is a string,
that will render the value within a span tag.

Config is defined with OpenAPI 3.0 meaning that each item can be one of:

* string
* number (integer is treated as number)
* boolean
* object
* array

There are several methods of entering values for a config item:

* Static: Manually enter a value. This is a text field for string and number,
a toggle for boolean, and a JSON editor for object and array. This is the default mode for
object and array.

* Form: This is only applicable for object and array items.
It allows the you to enter each array item or object field as a static value.

* Widget: If a widget on the page has an exposed property matching the type of the
config item it can be used as a value. Widgets from other pages cannot be used.

* Variable: Variable's that match the type of the config item can be used as a value.

* Iterable: If the widget is a child of an iterable widget, it can use the iterator
as it's value.
