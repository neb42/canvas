# Widgets

The UI is built with pages.
Each page is defined by a tree of widgets.
A widget is a UI element that is rendered to the screen.
They are defined with components, either internally, through templates,
or built within the UI.

A widget is configured through its [config](/widgets/config), [layout](/widgets/layout), [events](/widgets/events), and [styles](/widgets/styles).
Every widget has styles configuration, but the rest are dependant on the widget's component definition.

Widgets are organised into categories.
The internal widgets have predefined categories, templates are categorised based on their configuration,
and custom components are categorised as `Components`.
