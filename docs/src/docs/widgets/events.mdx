# Widget events

A widget can have any number of events. For example, a Button widget may have an `onClick` event.
For each event any number of event instances may take place. There are three types of event instances:

## Trigger action

Any API endpoint that is a `POST` request is considered an action.
These endpoints will not show in variables, but will in events.
When defining a trigger action event you can select an endpoint and configure it's parameters. 
The response is ignored.

## Navigate page

If your app contains multiple pages you can navigate between them with events.

## Update variable

Some variables are configured to update in response to an event.
This means that when their input changes they will not update, until
and update variable event occurs.
