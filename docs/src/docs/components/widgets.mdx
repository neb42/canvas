# Building components from widgets

Building components in React provide the most flexibility,
but they require the skills of a frontend engineer.
Reusable components are a useful concept for anyone.
To allow for this it is possible to build a component in the builder.
This is similar to creating a page.

These components are generic within a project, but not outside of a project.
To share these components outside of a project you can create a template with a `client.json`
containing them.

Next to the page selection dropdown, there is a plus button.
Click this and then click `Component` in the menu that opens.
This will create new component.

This interface will be very similar to a page.
You can create your component here as you would create a page
and it can be used elsewhere, but it will not be generic.

In order to make a component generic, first select the root element in the tree.
There are two new tabs on the right-hand panel.

## Config

For a widget the config panel will specify which values to use for the config.
For a component you are defining the configuration.
Here you can add an item, choose it's type, default value, etc. Currently objects are not supported as types.
When adding a widget to the tree of a component you can choose to use one of the component config items as it's value.

## Exposed properties

Each widget in the tree can have it's exposed properties.
In this tab you can surface a property to the component, rename it, and then allow it to be used elsewhere.
