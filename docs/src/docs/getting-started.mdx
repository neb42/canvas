UI Studio is built using javascript. This means that you will need to install node and a package manager to get started.

## Installing Node

To install node we recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node versions.

> UI Studio requires a minimum node version of 14, but we recommend installing the latest LTS release.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
```

And add this to your profile file (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`).

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

Install a node version.
```bash
nvm install 16
```

And set it as your default version.
```bash
nvm alias default 16
```

## Installing a package manager

Currently only [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) is supported as a package manager. To install Yarn:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

## Creating a UI Studio application

To create an empty application run:

```bash
yarn create ui-studio <NAME>
```

UI Studio works best when used with [templates](/templates/using). To create an application with a template run:
```bash
yarn create ui-studio <NAME> -t <TEMPLATE> <TEMPLATE>
```

For example, to create an application named "MyApp" that uses the example template:

```bash
yarn create ui-studio MyApp -t @ui-studio/example 
```

This has now generated an application and initialised a git repository. To start the application run:

```bash
cd <NAME>
yarn start
```

The terminal will now show the output of the build process and a browser window should open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
