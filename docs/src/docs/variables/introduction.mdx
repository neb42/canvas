# Variables

Variables allow you to connect data to your widgets.
They use an OpenAPI V3 schema for their type and can be used
in any widget config or API parameter that accepts that type.

Variables are global and can be used across pages.
This allows for a widget's property to be shared across pages via a variable.

There are three types of variables:

* [Static](/variables/static)
* [Function](/variables/function)
* [Lookup](/variables/lookup)
