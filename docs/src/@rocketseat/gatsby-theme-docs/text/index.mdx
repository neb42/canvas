# Introduction

UI Studio is an open source web based UI builder.

## Features

- Design system agnostic
- Connect to any REST api via OpenAPI
- Use community templates to get started or integrate your own design system with React
- Build reusable components within the UI
- Open source!

## Motivation

Other UI builders are often too restrictive. They come with a default set of components and offer no (or little) options for customisation and reusability.

* Built for engineers who do not know frontend development
* Highly customisable UI components while still being reusable
* Connect to any datasource by just using a REST api
